Forthcoming. Still trying to figure out how to comply with the Rubinius license (as I've used a lot of the Rubinius Array code) without having explicitly forked Rubinius. If anyone knows what I'm sposed to do, let me know. Otherwise, I'm going to ask some of the B'more on Rails folk at the next Open Source Hack Night.
