h2. @progenitor_binding

Probly should refactor @#take_progenitor_binding@ and @#new_with_binding@ binding into a class method. No point for them to be convoluted instance methods. Makes for confusing code when @#bastardize@ calls @@array = self.new_with_binding@

h2. :[]=

It might be the case that I don't need to provide any special handling for @:[]=@ since it never deletes and will only affect the size of a non-empty array by appending onto the end. I'll be keeping an eye out for any cases where it would be necessary to implement it specially rather than just delegate it to @@array@.
