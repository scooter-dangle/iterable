h2. @progenitor_binding

Probly should refactor @#take_progenitor_binding@ and @#new_with_binding@ binding into a class method. No point for them to be convoluted instance methods. Makes for confusing code when @#bastardize@ calls @@array = self.new_with_binding@

NOTE: These methods have changed. I now just pass the original IterableArray down the object/iteration chain rather than a binding. I think I originally used bindings because I was a n00b and didn't fully trust the difference between references to objects and the objects themselves.

h2. tracking

Currently, if the yielded element of the array is deleted during the iteration block, the element immediately to the right of that element will be followed in the event that the order of the elements in the array is altered.

This means that the next element to be yielded is given priority when going forward, and the previous element is given priority when traversing the array backward. I think this is an error.

I'll be fixing this by adding a tracking instance variable that will result in the *next* element being followed whether we're traversing the array forward or backward.

If I get that set up correctly, I might also add a method to allow the user to toggle between next-element and previous-element tracking.
